# Arrest Alert

Arrest Alert is a cross platform app built with Flutter, this is a complete rebuild of my previous attempt at making this project. This app implements the [JailBase]([https://www.jailbase.com/api] (https://www.jailbase.com/api)) API which provides arrest data from a large number of sources.
